This project presents a non-destructive plant nutrient assessment system powered by image processing and spectral analysis techniques. The goal is to detect subtle nutrient deficiencies in plants—such as nitrogen stress—without physically harming them. By analyzing leaf images and identifying spectral or visual patterns associated with nutrient levels, this approach offers a scalable solution for:

🌱 Enhancing crop monitoring

📈 Optimizing fertilizer application

🛡️ Preserving plant health and yield potential

This tool is particularly valuable for precision agriculture, enabling early diagnosis and decision-making to support sustainable and efficient farming practices.
