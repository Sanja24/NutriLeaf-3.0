## ðŸŒ¿ About

This project implements a **non-destructive plant nutrient assessment system** using **image processing and deep learning techniques** to classify plant health based on nutrient availability. The primary focus is detecting **nitrogen deficiencies** in maize plants by analyzing leaf imagesâ€”without causing any damage to the plant.

By leveraging **spectral features and visual cues**, this system enables early and accurate diagnosis of nutrient stress, helping farmers make informed decisions in real time.

## ðŸ§ª Application Overview

* **Objective**: Identify nutrient stress levels (e.g., N0, N75, Healthy) in maize plants using leaf imagery.
* **Methodology**: Image classification using a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a custom dataset.
* **Use Case**: Early-stage nutrient diagnosis for **precision agriculture** to enhance yield and reduce unnecessary fertilizer use.
